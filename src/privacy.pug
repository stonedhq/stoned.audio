          | cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain
          | types of information whenever you interact with our website through your

          | 3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
        p
          | To Provide Products, Services, and Information: As described above, we
          | collect information from you so that we can provide products and services
          | that you purchase at the Site, and provide information that you request
          | from us. We use your personally identifiable information to contact you
          | about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship
          | products to you. We may send you information about our products and
          | services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party
          | service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver
          | products and services that you purchase from us. We may use third parties
          | to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide
          | marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information
          | from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will
          | have access to your personally identifiable information in order to provide
          | these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual
          | and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping
          | us provide the service.
        p
          | Advertising: We may use how you browse and shop in
          | order to show you ads for Us or our advertising partners that are more
          | relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to
          | provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are
          | ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide
          | you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may
          | be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites
          | not owned by Us. We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing
          | history across participating websites to show you interest-based
          | advertisements on those websites. You can opt-out of receiving
          | interest-based ads from us by sending an email to support@stoned.audio.
          | Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to
          | see ads on our Site, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.
          | If your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to
          | indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads, we
          | will treat that signal as an opt-out. We allow advertising networks to
          | collect personally identifiable information about our user’s online
          | activities when you leave this Site. To learn more about interest-based
          | advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital
          | Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (
          | www.aboutads.infoand www.networkadvertising.org).

          | Third Party Advertising & Marketing:
          | We treat all your personally identifiable information as
          | confidential. We do not sell, rent, or share personally identifiable
          | information with third parties for the third party to market its products
          | and services.
        p
          | Your Consent: In addition to the sharing described elsewhere
          | in this Policy, we will share personally identifiable information with
          | companies, organizations or individuals apart from Us when we have your
          | consent to do so.
        p
          | Legal Proceedings:  We will share personally identifiable
          | information with third party companies, organizations or individuals
          | apart from Us if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation
          | or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Meet any
          | applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable
          | governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms and Conditions, including
          | investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise
          | address fraud, security or technical issues. Protect against harm to the
          | rights, property or safety of Us, our users, customers or the public as
          | required or permitted by law. Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of
          | Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business
          | changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the
          | Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy
          | proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personally
          | identifiable information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted
          | otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the
          | promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree
          | differently.

          | measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your

          | information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach
          | of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your

          | the “Services”. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these
          | Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use any of our

          | provided along with the description of any product put up for sale.  If no

          | guarantees or warranties.  In the event of a relevant defect, or questions

          | for return instructions. In general, our sole obligation under this

          | original warranty. This warranty does not apply to Products damaged by
          | misuse, accident, or normal wear and tear. The Product is not designed for
          | or warranted against damage from use in areas subject to extreme

          | PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES
          | ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR
          | INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON
          | WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY
          | OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
          | POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS
          | FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. In no event will Our
          | total liability arising out of or in connection with THESE TERMS OR FROM
          | THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE the Services or PRODUCTS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS
          | YOU HAVE PAID TO US FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS GIVING RISE TO
          | THE LIABILITY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
          | of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above
          | limitations may not apply to you.
        h2
          | Dispute Resolution, Governing Law
        p
          | These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of
          | the State of Nevada without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
        h2
          | Agreement to Arbitrate
        p
          | You and We agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
          | or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
          | interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content
          | (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except
          | that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in
          | small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in
          | a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
          | infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
          | trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights
          | (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection
          | Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the
          | right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Us with written
          | notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at 1681 Belarra
          | Street, Minden, NV 89423 within thirty (30) days following the date you
          | first agree to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”).
          | If you don’t provide Us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the
          | thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and
          | intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly
          | set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. Unless you timely provide Us
          | with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and
          | Us are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a
          | plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative
          | proceeding. Further, unless both you and We otherwise agree in writing,
          | the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may
          | not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
          | proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
          | entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except
          | as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section
          | will survive any termination of these Terms.
        h2
          | Arbitration Rules
        p
          | The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
          | Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and
          | the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA
          | Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution”
          | section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling
          | the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
          | interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
        h2
          | Arbitration Process
        p
          | A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
          | with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The
          | AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be
          | either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be
          | selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the
          | parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
          | delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the
          | arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
        h2
          | Arbitration Location and Procedure
        p
          | Unless you and We otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in
          | the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then
          | the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that
          | you and We submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or
          | the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim
          | exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
          | Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to
          | direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with
          | the expedited nature of the arbitration.
        h2
          | Arbitrator’s Decision
        p
          | The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the
          | AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings
          | and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the
          | arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
          | The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
          | “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of
          | damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award
          | declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to
          | the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
          | individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an
          | award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under
          | applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may
          | have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it
          | prevails in arbitration.
        h2
          | Fees
        p
          | Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator
          | fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim
          | for damages does not exceed $75,000, We will pay all such fees unless
          | the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
          | sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an
          | improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
          | Civil Procedure 11(b)).
        h2
          | Changes
        p

          | section above, if We change this “Dispute Resolution” section after
          | the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes
          | to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written
          | notice (including by email to Our Site) within 30 days of the date
          | such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above
          | or in the date of Our email to you notifying you of such change. By
          | rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute
          | between you and Us in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute
          | Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or
          | accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

          | General Terms
        p
          | These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
          | between Us and you regarding the Services (including Products and

          | oral or written understandings or agreements between Us and you
          | regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held
          | invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the
          | terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent
          | jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us
          | an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth
          | above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
          | and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
          | effect.  You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
          | otherwise, without Our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to
          | assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We
          | may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to
          | the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the
          | parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Any notices or other
          | communications provided by Us under these Terms, including those
          | regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or
          | (ii) by posting to the Services.  For notices made by e-mail, the date of
          | receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
          | Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          | be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such
          | right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a
          | duly authorized representative of Us. Except as expressly set forth in
          | these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
          | these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
          | Terms or otherwise.
